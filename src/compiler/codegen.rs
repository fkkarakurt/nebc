//! # Code Generation Interface
//!
//! This module provides the high-level interface for the code generation phase of the
//! Nebulang compiler. The primary role of the [`CodeGenerator`] is to take the
//! processed Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and transform it into the final target code,
//! typically assembly language.
//!
//! The actual complex logic is implemented within the `codegen::` sub-modules,
//! specifically the [`QuantumAssemblyGenerator`] (though currently abstracted away
//! by this placeholder).

use crate::ast::nodes::*;
use crate::compiler::error::CompileError;

/// The structure responsible for orchestrating the final phase of compilation:
/// translating the AST into executable machine code (or assembly).
pub struct CodeGenerator;

#[allow(dead_code)]
impl CodeGenerator {
    /// Generates the target assembly code from the program's Abstract Syntax Tree.
    ///
    /// **NOTE**: In the current version, this function serves as a placeholder
    /// and should eventually delegate to the more complex generation logic
    /// in the `codegen::quantum_asm` module.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// * `_ast` - The root [`Program`] AST node (currently unused).
    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// A `Result` containing the generated assembly code as a `String` or a [`CompileError`].
    pub fn generate(_ast: &Program) -> Result<String, CompileError> {
        Ok(String::from("// Generated binary placeholder\n"))
